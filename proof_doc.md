Airline, Hotel, or Travel Credit Cards? There are many categories to choose from and within those categories there are many different types of cards. Do you want cards that you can redeem travel expenses directly or do want cards with specific airline points? Are you loyal to one airline or do you fly the cheapest fare always? These questions are tough to answer so we have created a series of articles detailing how to begin the selection process to find the travel credit card that BEST fits your travel needs.

### About Page

[About Page](https://www.toomanymiles.com/about)

Why Me?

Two years ago, I traveled completely around the world for free. How? By strategically applying for travel credit cards and using the points I earned to pay for flights. In total, I took 13 flights without spending any real cash. I want to share what I learned, so that you, too, can explore the world without breaking the bank.

Why Too Many Miles?

Travel credit cards offer excellent sign up bonuses. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, is currently offering 45,000 points if you spend $4,000 in 3 months. These points can be converted to airline miles and offer you a chance to see the world for free. In this case, Chase is giving away approximately $625 in flights!

The problem? These sign up bonuses are fleeting. Some months, the deals are better than others, and the best deals can disappear quickly. Our app tracks bonuses across a variety of cards and provides recommendations based on the cards' current offers relative to their historical offers. We will coach you to apply at the correct time, and receive the largest bonus possible!
