      <h2>Why Me?</h2>

      <p><strong>Above is the outline from my world trip from 2 years ago.</strong></p>

      <p>I went completely around the world backpacking on a 'shoestring.' In total, I took 13 flights without spending any real cash. I did this by applying for credit cards and using the miles earned to pay for my flights. I learned a lot about travel credit card miles in the process and built an app to help share that knowledge.</p>

      <h2>Why Too Many Miles?</h2>

      <p><strong>Travel credit cards offer excellent sign up bonuses.</strong></p>

      <p>For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, is currently offering 50,000 points. These points/miles offer travelers a chance to see the world for free. In the case of Chase, this is approximately $625 in free flights.</p>

      <p>The problem, however, is that often these sign up bonuses change - some months the deals are better than others. My app tracks these bonuses across a variety of cards and provides recommendations based on the cards' current bonus relative to their historical bonuses.</p>
