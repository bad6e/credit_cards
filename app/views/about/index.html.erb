      <h2>Why Me?</h2>

      <p> <a href="http://www.sweatersaga.com/" class="active">Two years ago</a>, I traveled completely around the world. In total, I took 13 flights without spending any real cash. I did this by applying for travel credit cards and using the miles earned to pay for my flights. This experience taught me a lot about travel credit cards. Our hope is that our app will help share this knowledge.</p>

      <h2>Why Too Many Miles?</h2>

      <p>Travel credit cards offer excellent sign up bonuses. For example, the <%= link_to @linked_card.name, card_path(@linked_card), class: "active" %>, is currently offering <%= number_with_delimiter(@linked_card.rewards.first.amount) %> points if you spend <%= number_to_currency(@linked_card.rewards.first.spending_amount, precision: 0) %> in <%= pluralize(@linked_card.rewards.first.length_of_time, "Month") %>. These points/miles offer travelers a chance to see the world for free. In the case of Chase, this is approximately $625 in free flights!</p>

      <p><strong>The problem, however, is that often these sign up bonuses change</strong> - some months the deals are better than others. Our app tracks these bonuses across a variety of cards and <%= link_to "provides recommendations", category_path(@best_cards), class: "active" %> based on the cards' current bonus relative to their historical bonuses. By applying at the correct time, you are able to receive the biggest bonus possible.</p>
