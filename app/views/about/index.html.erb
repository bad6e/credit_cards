      <h2>Why Me?</h2>

      <p> <a href="http://www.sweatersaga.com/" class="active">Two years ago</a>, I traveled completely around the world for free. How? By strategically applying for travel credit cards and using the points I earned to pay for flights.  In total, I took 13 flights without spending any real cash.  I want to share what I learned, so that you, too, can explore the world without breaking the bank.</p>

      <h2>Why Too Many Miles?</h2>

      <p>Travel credit cards offer excellent sign up bonuses. For example, the <%= link_to @linked_card.name, card_path(@linked_card), class: "active" %>, is currently offering <%= number_with_delimiter(@linked_card.rewards.first.amount) %> points if you spend <%= number_to_currency(@linked_card.rewards.first.spending_amount, precision: 0) %> in <%= pluralize(@linked_card.rewards.first.length_of_time, "month") %>. These points can be converted to airline miles and offer you a chance to see the world for free. In this case, Chase is giving away approximately $625 in flights!</p>

      <p><strong>The problem? These sign up bonuses are fleeting.</strong> Some months, the deals are better than others, and the best deals can disappear quickly. Our app tracks bonuses across a variety of cards and <%= link_to "provides recommendations", category_path(@best_cards), class: "active" %> based on the cards' current offers relative to their historical offers. We will coach you to apply at the correct time, and receive the largest bonus possible!</p>
